Intro To programming, dungeon choose adventure game
Has bugs, just trying to learn concepts and apply them. 
There are several bugs I know of that need to be fixed. Also if you say yes to the tutorial, there is no tutorial as it has not been added. you can say no to any (y or n) question. There are routes completed for all this. Try saying no to entering the dungeon and refusing to apologize when prompted to. 
There is also a small chart for what I have finished so far. It will be added to as more routes get added.
